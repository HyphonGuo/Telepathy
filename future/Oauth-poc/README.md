# Authentication & Authorization PoC Design for Telepathy based on Oauth 2.0

## Backgroud

Currently Telepathy works without security, while the security of HPC pack is based on Active Directory (AD) in windows server, which is not cross platform. Besides, the authentication model is expected to stand alone with authorization in recent software design, so that when some changes happen in authentication, only authentication server needs to update instead of client and service server.
